\section*{Preface}
This document is compiled from experiences of several students and teachers, past and current, and may not 100\% reflect the experience that you will have.
But knowing how little change the subject underwent in the past years, I are betting on our advice staying relevant for a few more.
Even though I cannot give you the exact answers to every problem MAS will throw at you, in writing this, I am attempting to make the subject more predictable and bearable.
While you can read-as-you-go, it is greatly encouraged that you skim the whole document before the semester, to get the general feeling around the subject.
\\[0.5em]
I will be including shortcuts that you can take if you are only aiming to pass the subject with a \texttt{3}. They will be marked like this:

\justpassing{Read the document before the semester and pay attention to what's marked as critical. Sometimes there are parts of the project that if done first make the rest easier, and they might not be the ones worth the most points.}

\section*{Subject outline}

MAS is an artiaficially hard subject. Thus, it is quite unfair in its nature.

One change from BYT that you will probably enjoy - no more unit tests!
Not necessarily because you don't need them, unit tests are good in every situation, rather you will not have time to write them.
Unit tests are not a requirement in any part of this subject, probably for the better.

The subject consists of 3 parts:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Mini projects
    \item Final project documentation
    \item Final project implementation

\end{enumerate}

To proceed to the next part, one needs to pass (obtain at least 50\
grade) the previous part. To pass the subject one needs to pass all individual parts.

There are no exemptions from the exam.
\\[0.5em]
{\small\textit{Out of 8 groups (around 150 people) from summer 2024-2025 that I have access to, only one person has a 5 from the tutorials. It's possible to get a 5, but the structure of the subject is artiaficially hard and is actively working against you. -Ekre}}

\subsection*{Mini-projects}

You will have one (sometimes two, but expect one) week to create each final project. The deadline is usually set to midnight before the defence day, and before the defences you are presented with the next project.


In case of every project, each task requirement has to have its own example object in the implementation.
This means that you can only use a variable/method/class to showcase one requirement for the task.

Here is an example related to MP1:

\begin{lstlisting}
// Bad implementation
class Person {
    // Example of a complex attribute as well as an optional attribute (too much)
    private DateOnly? BirthDate;
}

// Good implementation
class Worker {
    // Example of a complex attribute
    private DateOnly HiredDate;
    // Example of an optional attribute
    private DateOnly? FiredDate;
}
\end{lstlisting}

If you use more than one example in a single variable/method/class, you will probably only get points for one of them, at the descression of the teacher.

Note that in the second example, \texttt{FiredDate} can technically server as both \texttt{optional} and \texttt{complex}, but since \texttt{HiredDate} already handles the \texttt{complex} example, it does not constiture a mistake.
\\[0.5em]
Remember: \textbf{You} are assigning the labels to each example. No matter how complex the examples are, as long as you are using only one label for each object, you will be fine.

\justpassing{
    Use the first 3 projects to get over the 50\
    in the PRI and BYT classes, which you have hopefully taken.
    Use the other 2 to catch up to a passing grade if you couldn't do it with the first 3.
    You should still pay attention on MP4 and MP5, as those topics will also be present in the final project.
    If you got over 50 points from the first 3, you may use this time to prepare for the final project.
}

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{MP1 - Classes and Attributes}
\section*{MP1 - Classes and Attributes}
This project is quite straightforward.

Design a system (UML + implementation) that includes all of the following:
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Attribute types}:\texttt{complex}, \texttt{multivalue}, \texttt{optional}, \texttt{class}, \texttt{derived}.
    \item \textbf{Methods types}: \texttt{static}, \texttt{overload}, \texttt{override}.
    \item Class extent and persistence for class extents.
\end{itemize}


%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Class extent}
\subsection*{Class extent}
Check out Lecture 4 and the \texttt{ObjectPlus} class.

To save some time in the future, look ahead into lectures 6 (\texttt{ObjectPlusPlus} class) and 8 (\texttt{ObjectPlus4} class).
Implementing these classes early and using them as the base class for all future projects will save a lot of headache.
You can download future leactures from the FTP server.
\\[0.5em]
Remember to secure the class extent by making it \texttt{private}.
Objects should be automatically inserted into the extent by the constructor.

You should have a method to retrieve the whole extent, and optionally to delete some / all objects from the extent.


%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Persistence}
\subsection*{Persistence}

As of summer 24/25, only binary serialization is allowed. Keep this in mind, and verify with your teacher.

Binary serialization saves the exact state of the object, but is deprecated in most languages.
It is recommended to implement your own serialization functions.

Remember that your serialization and desirialization have to happen in one call.

\begin{lstlisting}
// wrong
MySerializer.Serialize(Person.GetExtent());
MySerializer.Serialize(Job.GetExtent());

// OK
MySerializer.AddToQueue(Person.GetExtent());
MySerializer.AddToQueue(Job.GetExtent());
MySerializer.SerializeAll();
\end{lstlisting}

If you are unsure if your code is "one call", count the number of times the serialization file is opened.
You should have:
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item One file to serialize all data
    \item One syscall to open the file for reading the data (deserialization at the start of the programme)
    \item One syscall to open the file for writing the data (serialization at the end of the programme)
\end{itemize}

If unsure, hardcode the order of serialization. You do not have to overthink this part, as this is the only time when you will be using serialization.

Next persistence project is MP5 - using a database, and the final project also requires a database.

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attribute - complex}
\subsection*{Attribute - complex}
For \texttt{complex} attributes, find a build-in type in the language you use.
A good example is date-time structs/classes.
They are already present in most languages:

\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Java} - \docref{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Date.html}{java.util.Date}
    \item \textbf{C\#} - \docref{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime}{System.DateTime}
    \item \textbf{C++} - \docref{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/chrono/time_point.html}{std::chrono::time_point}
\end{itemize}

Note that C\#'s \texttt{DateTime} is a \textit{value type}, since it is a struct.
Structs still count as complex attributes.

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attribute - multivalue}
\subsection*{Attribute - multivalue}
\texttt{multivalue} attributes \textit{must} be implemented as a collection.
\textbf{Do not} create several attributes to represent multiple values.

\begin{lstlisting}
// wrong
PhoneNumber? phone1;
PhoneNumber? phone2;

// correct
PhoneNumber?[] phones = new PhoneNumber?[2];
\end{lstlisting}

Remember to implement proper validators,
the \texttt{multivalue} attribute has to have at least one value at all times if it is not \texttt{optional}.

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attribute - optional}
\subsection*{Attribute - optional}
For \texttt{optional} attributes, there's usually a built-in solution

\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Java} - \docref{https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html}{java.util.Optional}, or alternatively, leave the reference types as \texttt{null} (not recommended)
    \item \textbf{C\#} - adding a question mark (\texttt{?}) after a type is a shorthand for \docref{https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.nullable}{System.Nullable<>}
          \begin{lstlisting}
// these are equivalent
int? a;
Nullable<int> a;
\end{lstlisting}
    \item \textbf{C++} - \docref{https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/utility/optional.html}{std::optional}
\end{itemize}

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attribute - class}
\subsection*{Attribute - class}
Mark class attributes with a \texttt{static} keyword.

Class attributes are useful for:
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item Extents
          \begin{lstlisting}
static List<Object> extent = [];
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Avoiding magic numbers
          \begin{lstlisting}
static int MaxNameLength = 32;
static double OvertimePayMultiplier = 1.5;
\end{lstlisting}

    \item Flags
          \begin{lstlisting}
static bool EnableLogging = true;
\end{lstlisting}
\end{itemize}

Remember to implement proper setter validators or mark attributes as \texttt{const / readonly}.

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Attribute - derived}
\subsection*{Attribute - derived}
A universal approach to derived attributes is a getter method.
\begin{lstlisting}
private DateOnly BirthDate;
public int GetAge() {
    return /* calculate age here */ ;
}
\end{lstlisting}

C\# also allows for read-only properties
\begin{lstlisting}
private DateOnly BirthDate;
public int Age {
    get {
        return /* calculate age here */ ;
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The value of derived attributes should \textit{never} be stored,
rather it should be calculated on the fly for each get call.


%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Method - static}
\subsection*{Method - static}
The easiest way to implement a static method is to operate on the extent.

E.g.:
\begin{lstlisting}
public static List<Object> GetExtent() {/**/};
public static int GetExtentLength() {/**/};
public static void PrintExtent() {/**/};
public static void ClearExtent() {/**/};
\end{lstlisting}

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Method - overload}
\subsection*{Method - overload}
Overload methods by creating multiple methods with the same name but different signatures.

Remember that methods that only differ in return types will not compile.

\begin{lstlisting}
// this is a good example of overloading
public int GetTotalPrice(Order order) {/**/}
public double GetTotalPrice(Order order, double discount) {/**/}

// this will not compile
public int GetTotalPrice(Order order) {/**/}
public double GetTotalPrice(Order order) {/**/}
\end{lstlisting}

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Method - override}
\subsection*{Method - override}
For Java and C\#, use a custom \texttt{ToString()} method.
If your teacher does not accept \texttt{ToString()} methods,
or you use C++, you will need a basic inheritance example.

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{MP2 - Associations}
\section*{MP2 - Associations}

Design a system (UML + implementation) that includes all of the following:
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Association types}: \texttt{basic}, \texttt{qualified}, \texttt{composition}, \texttt{with attribute}. \\
          (\texttt{aggregation} and \texttt{reflex} associations might not be required, check in with your teacher)
    \item \textbf{Reverse connections}: Reverse connections are mandatory for every association. Make sure you have at least some tests for this, infinite loops are the most common issue.
\end{itemize}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Association - basic}
\subsection*{Association - basic}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.1\textheight]{basic_association_example}
    \caption{A basic association} \label{fig:basic_association_example}
\end{figure}

The above example might be implemented in the following way:

\begin{lstlisting}
class Worker {
    Company? worksAt; // this is nullable since the multiplicity is 0..1
}

class Company {
    List<Worker> employees = []; // this list is never null but may be empty
}
\end{lstlisting}

Avoid using [1..*] - [1..*] or [1] - [1] multiplicities, as they would require additional constructors / factory methods for creating pairs of objects.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.1\textheight]{bad_multiplicities}
    \caption{Bad choice of multiplicities} \label{fig:bad_multiplicities}
\end{figure}

Since both \texttt{C} and \texttt{D} require the other one to exist, their constructor might look something like this:

\begin{lstlisting}
(C, D) CreatePairCD(object paramsForC, object paramsForD) {
    C tmpC = new C();       // invalid object, no reference
    D tmpD = new D(tmpC);   // valid object
    C.setD(tmpD);           // now also a valid object
    return (tmpC, tmpD);    // return both
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that this factory accesses a bad constructor for \texttt{C} - the one with no arguments.
This constructor should be private and accessible only to factory methods.
This implementation adds complexity and is not recommended.

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Association - qualified}
\subsection*{Association - qualified}
Qualified associations should not be implemented using IDs (in general, avoid IDs where
possible, with the exception for database PKs). Here are some good options to use as a qualifier instead:

\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item company names,
    \item phone numbers,
    \item role name,
    \item location names,
    \item addresses,
    \item product codes,
    \item \texttt{datetime(now)},
    \item any other \textit{unique} string attribute, or
    \item a \textit{unique} combination of two or more attributes.
\end{itemize}

\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Association - composition}
\subsection*{Association - composition}

Composition associations involve 2 object, with one being dependent on the other.

For example, an article on a blog website consists of paragraphs, but an individual paragraph cannot be published (exist on its own) without being in an article.
In this relationship, we can label the article object as a "parent" and the paragraph object as a child.

When implementing composition pay attention to these cases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The child object must have a reference to the parent object, and this reference must never be \texttt{null}.
          To enforce this, the child object should take a parent object as one of the inputs in its constructor.
    \item If a parent object removes the reference to a child object, the child should be deleted. This is an important part in implementing reverse connections.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}
class Article {
    List<Paragraph> paragraphs;

    removeParagraph(Paragraph p) {
        paragraph.Remove(p);
        p.Delete();  // remember to delete the child object
    }
}

class Paragraph {
    Article parent;

    Paragraph(Article parent, ...) {
        this.parent = parent;   // this must never be null
        ...
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}

Whether the child object can be reassigned a parent (moved from one parent to another) is up to your use case and implementation.



\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Association - with attribute}
\subsection*{Association - with attribute}

Association with an attribute is usually implemented using an association class/struct.
These types of associations are mostly used in cases when extra information needs to be stored about the association itself, which does not directly correlate with either of the objects forming the association.

Consider a relationship between a worker and a company.
A worker might work for many different companies, and a company might have many employees.

Each company stores the historical data of all employees, when they joined, and when they quit.

Which class do we store the employee's join date for a particular company?

\begin{lstlisting}
class Employee {
    List<Employee_Company> companies;
}

class Employee_Company {
    Employee e;
    Company c;
    Date joined;
    Date? fired;
    ...
}

class Company {
    List<Employee_Company> employees;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The association class \texttt{Employee\_Company} can store an arbitrary amount of data for a relationship between a specific employee and a specific company.

Things to look out for:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The association class must alwayas have 2 valid references (pass them through a constructor).
    \item If an object gets deleted, all association classes must be deleted as well, after they are unlinked from both sides. \\
          I.e.:
          \begin{enumerate}
              \item A \texttt{Company} object receives a delete request,
              \item All associated \texttt{Employee\_Company} objects are notified that the \texttt{Company} is getting deleted,
              \item \texttt{Employee\_Company} objects unlink themselves from \texttt{Employee} objects,
              \item \texttt{Employee\_Company} objects delete themselves and send the confirmation back to \texttt{Company},
              \item The \texttt{Company} object deletes itself.
          \end{enumerate}
    \item Make sure that the data stored in the association class actually related to the association, and cannot be tied to one of the obejcts.
\end{itemize}

%==========================================================
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{MP3 - Inheritance}
\section*{MP3 - Inheritance}

Design a system (UML + implementation) that includes all of the following:

\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Inheritance types}: \texttt{abstract}, \texttt{disjoint}, \texttt{overlapping}, \texttt{dynamic}, \texttt{multi-inheritance}, \texttt{multi-aspect}
    \item \textbf{Analytical diagram}: Showcasing the \textbf{initial design} without limitations of programming.
    \item \textbf{Design diagram}: Showcasing the \textbf{actual implementation} taking into account the limitation of the language.
\end{itemize}

% - **Inheritance types**: `abstract`, `disjoint`, `overlapping`, `dynamic`,
%   `multi-inheritance`, `multi-aspect`.
%   Do not combine inheritance types for this project (e.g. `{overlapping, dynamic}`). It
%   will complicate the implementation and the defense. It's easier to implement an extra
%   class than a combined inheritance type. If needed, design several smaller systems (ask
%   your teacher if they think it would be better).

% - ****:
% - `static` - any type of constraint that is applied regardless if the attribute is being
% assigned for the first time or changed.
% - `dynamic` - any type of constraint that change depending on the value of the attribute.
% They only work on the update. For example:
% - Cannot increase / decrease value
% - Cannot change value more than X times per Y time
% - Value must change at least X times per Ys time
% - `unique` - self-explanatory, technically a static constrain. Use this constraint on some-
% thing other than the ID. This will get you extra points (or prevent you from losing
% some).
% - **Universal Constraints**:
% - `subset` - only applies if there are 2 or more associations between 2 classes. One associ-
% ation is the "main" association (superset), the other one(s) are the "dependent"
% associations (subset). The subset association can only exist if the superset as-
% sociation that links the same objects exists.
% Here is a StackOverflow question describing the subset association.
% https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70655850/what-does-subsets-mean-in-uml-exactly
% - `ordered` - basic constraint that is applied to a class / association / list attribute.
% States that the contents must be always sorted.
% - `bag` / `history` - allows duplicate associations between the two classes using an ex-
% tra association table (association class / association by attribute). I.e. stores a
% list of associations based on some identifier (usually date when the association
% was created / expired). If the association is not a bag / history, the previous
% association needs to be deleted if the new one gets added.
% - `XOR` - states that for the given 2 associations A1 and A2, either A1 **OR** A2 must exist,
% but **not both** and **not neither**.
% - "business logic" - not a real thing but some teachers ask to implement it. Business
% logic is whatever makes sense as constraint in your system. Write some custom
% validator and package it in a constraint.
% For example: "This string can be null, but if it is not null, it must be strictly
% longer than 9 characters" (like an optional phone number).
% - **Validators**:
% All constrains must be enforced with validators. If your teacher does not specify how
% to implement them, the choice is up to you. Common validators are annotations and
% if statements, do not overcomplicate the system if you don't have to

Connect the system to a database, in whatever method you see fit. The details are defined

\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Final Project Documentation}
\section*{Final Project Documentation}

The final project is split into two deadlines: the documentation and the implementation.
To defend the implementation, you must first pass the documentation. This section describes it.

You can re-take both the documentation and implementation once each, usually before the implementation defence and before the 2nd-term exam respectively.

A good rule of thumb for the size of the project is at least 80\% of the combined features of all mini-projects, or about as big as your final BYT project (if you have taken BYT previously).

As of writing this, some people note that this has now changed to somewhere around 50\% of the combined mini-projects, ask your teacher if you are not sure.

Grades are given based on the complexity of the system (not the real world complexity, but
rather the amount of stuff from mini projects that you can cram into it).
Try to implement as many different features without making the system complex to understand.

Approximate grading system for this part (for a total of 100 points):

\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item Complexity of the business domain - 10 points
    \item Documenting the use cases (use case scenario, use case diagram) - 10 points
    \item Correctness and complexity of the design class diagram - 35 points
    \item Correctness and complexity of the activity diagram - 10 points
    \item Correctness and complexity of the state diagram - 10 points
    \item GUI design - 10 points
    \item Discussion of the design decisions (dynamic analysis) - 10 points
    \item Readability and the organization of the document - 5 points
\end{itemize}

I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to have most of the stuff correct on the
first defense. If the teacher notices a lot of errors they might (allegedly) skip checking the
rest, give you feedback on the stuff that they checked, and send you for the next week's
defense. The problem arises when you realize that there are more errors that the teacher
hasn't checked and hasn't given feedback on. This means that you might be presenting a
faulty system for your last chance at a defense. Make sure that your system does not have
enough missing part to make the teacher "give up" on you during the first defense.

For the UI design, choose use cases that either:
\begin{enumerate} [noitemsep]
    \item creates an object based on already existing objects, e.g.:
          add a new appointment for the patient and the doctor, OR
    \item uses object referenced between already existing objects, e.g.:
          assign a product to a cart.
\end{enumerate}
Avoid use cases that just retrieve information, they are considered too primitive. Use cases
should also demonstrate reverse connections as much as possible.

\subsection*{Write comments}

This section exists just to beg you to write comments.
\begin{itemize} [noitemsep]
    \item They contribute to your final grade
    \item They made you remember what you wrote better, which is a huge lifesaver at the defence
    \item They make your code look more refined and professional
    \item They help with back pain for ages 50 and above (not licensed by the FDA)
\end{itemize}

Especially if you are re-taking the implementation of the final project at the end of the summer, use the extra time you have to write comments.

\subsection*{Database operations}

Teachers pay attention to the amount of database operations/connections that are used to retrieve the data.

In the GUI example, the "list within a list" should consist of \textbf{O(1)} database operations.
I.e. retrieving a list of all parent objects and all children objects should not be dependent on the number of objects.

Your call to the database should look something like this (pseudo-sql):
\begin{enumerate} [noitemsep]
    \item \texttt{SELECT * FROM parent, children, WHERE children.parentid = parent.id}, or
    \item \texttt{WITH x AS (SELECT * FROM parent);} \\ \texttt{SELECT * FROM children WHERE children.id IN x;}
\end{enumerate}

The goal is to retrieve all objects using one or two calls.
If the child objects are only retrieved during the loading of "list within a list" and not the top-level list, \textbf{it is the wrong way to implement it}.

Once the top-level list loads, both parent and child objects should be loaded into memory. When entering a "list within a list", \textbf{no extra queries should be made}.
